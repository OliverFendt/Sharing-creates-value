   * [*General*] Discussion
       * Tooling Group primarily focussed on automation of compliance in the supply chain
       * new use cases (via OpenChain) e.g. from ToDo-Group => need to be checked how we handle this in future
       * Open Source as business - potentially evolving in direction of "strategic" => thus may also have an impact on tooling group focus
       * Looking at processes? E.g. one product compiled of other sub-products; Administrative topics => use case mapping would be valuable - which tool for which use case?
